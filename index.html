    <h1>Stuff about me.</h1>
    <p>I am using this website for the purposes of my personal projects to future employers and the like. I will do my best to keep all the information up to date and give readers a feel for what coding projects I have done and maybe some self reflection
        on them.

    <h2>Personal Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        I grew up in south eastern Ohio in a small town where I lacked high speed internet, played to many video games and started coding with arduino in my dads garage. There weren't any STEM classes offered at the high school I went to so when it came to learning
        about programming I was one my own until college. So, growing up I had very little exposure to programming. I spent a lot of time with my father working on cars in the garage and eventually completely rebuilding his 1999 Doge Ram from sand blasting
        the frame, doing a little body work and even setting up a makeshift paint booth. I loved tinkering in the garage not just with machinery, which was pretty cool with my dad, but also circuitry. That tinkering worked well with my simple arduino
        powered circuits and prototypes. So, although I really liked working on machines, like what a mechanical engineer does, the act of programming won me over. Programming lets you build all kinds of 'objects' but also build abstract 'objects' and
        create logic. In the end, programming peaks my curiosity and imagination more than heavy machinery which is why I choose computer science. The capabilities of awesome platforms like Cloud are what I want to stake a career in. I taught myself a
        little C++ which helped me greatly in learning more about the language freshmen year at ONU. There I learned far more about object oriented programming, inheritcy, access modifiers, and being wary of memory.
